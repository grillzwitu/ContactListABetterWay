# ContactListABetterWay

This project is a simple android app that showcases the use of __RecyclerView__, __LayoutManager__, __Adapter__ classes, __Binding__, __Intent__ using the kotlin programming language.  
The app is a __Contacts__ app, when launched it shows contact categories in a recycler view, which when clicked opens the respective categories where a phone contact can be added
by clicking on a __floating action button__, that generates an __input form__ in a __dialog__, which then saves/adds the contact to the list by clicking the __save button__.  

__Note__: This app does not yet save the contacts created in any database, once the user exits a contact category list/view the contact list is cleared.
